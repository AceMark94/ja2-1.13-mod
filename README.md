# ja2-1.13-mod

In this file, all tweaks and add-ons will be listed in detail with possible options so lesser interaction with github copilot can be achieved to not hit the limit.

-Zombie tweaks

1. Zombies are globally present with random nests and spawn locations. they roam the sectors and are visible with violet dots just like deidriana's army or milita. they have an unlimited pool.

2. they roam, are stationary or investigate nearby sectors where there have been fights or incursions. They still raid towns and may engage roaming troops.

3. they also can enter during a battle at day or night since firefights cause noise. so a spawn chance during battles between player+militia+army can occur ar any given time with toggleable options 3 levels. so they can enter the map from the edge or spawn from old building with no civilians inside.

4. they attack anyone and do not take sides. they come in grous of 8 to 20. their presence in strategic map can be toggled in 3 levels to adjust intensity.

-Milita tweaks

1. Milita placement in town sectors will be tighter to make them more defensive. Roaming milita may engage zombies if they spot groups of zombies approaching towns.


-Enemy tweaks

1. deidriana's troops also engage raoming zombies. if player is not present, all battles eg. zombie vs. militia or zombie vs. army can be automated battles with the in-game existing autobattle pop up.

-IMP gear tweak

1. IMP starting gear selection will have more options such as revolvers, starting pump action shotguns, break-barrel shotguns, their respective ammo types, corresponding holsters. part of the default choices.

- Item addition

1. There will be deployable solar light garden spikes which can be baught from local shops and bobby ray's. Light range 4-5 tiles. they can use the same place holder as the break light item for easier integration. they will light during night time only and are ignored by enemies. no batteries needed since they are solar.

- Weapon tweaks

1. Basic shotguns, revolvers, pitols and smg's are more common in the early game along with light explosives such as genades and 40mm. the range of these weapons can be increased to make them more useful ( shotgun spread tigher) revolvers have a tad more accuracy and damage vs 9mm etc.
